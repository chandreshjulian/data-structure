## Binary Heap
Very similar to BST but has different rules

### Max Binary Heap
Parent nodes are always larger than child node

### Min Binary Heap
Parent nodes are always smaller than child node

### Priority Queue
DS where each element has some priority. Priority with the higher will be servered first.

### BigO
Insertion - O(log N)
Removal - O(log N)
Search - O(N)
